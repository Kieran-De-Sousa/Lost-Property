# Lost Property
Lost Property is a 32-bit pixel platformer created in Unity Engine version 2019.4. Originally a team of three, three-day game jam project for the Global Game Jam 2021, Lost Property became a project iterated upon in our first year Games Technology module ‘Game Development Evolution’. At this point the project expanded to a team of five. The project featured full art assets and sprite sheets for the project, touch screen controls, combat and AI and full design and technical documentation. This two-parter project was incredibly useful to us for learning how to work among a team of game designers, artists and programmers and the quick iterative process involved within game jams.
